# Nutrition Prediction

The "Nutrition Prediction" project aims to develop a solution that can assist individuals in managing their health and dietary intake more effectively. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze nutritional data and create a classification model that can predict essential information about the food consumed by users, such as nutritional values, calories, and potential health impacts.

Main Objectives:

* Better Nutrition Understanding: This project aims to provide users with a better understanding of nutrition. By analyzing nutritional data from food, the machine learning model will provide information about the nutritional composition of the food, including protein, carbohydrates, fats, fiber, vitamins, and minerals.
* Health Management: This project will assist individuals in managing their health. By predicting the nutritional value of food, users can make better decisions about what they eat, helping them achieve health goals such as weight loss, diabetes management, or meeting specific dietary requirements.
* Nutritional Awareness: In addition to helping individuals personally, this project also aims to raise awareness about nutrition in general. By providing easily understandable information about food, this project can help the general public make healthier food choices.
